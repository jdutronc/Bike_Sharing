NYC CitiBike

# Project Overview

After a very enjoyable holiday in New York City we decide to explore the business opportunity to launch a bike sharing service in our hometown of Des Moines, IA. Our friend Kate has a potential seed investor interested in our project and we must dive deeper into the mechanics of how the bike sharing service works in NYC before we can adapt the model to Des Moines.


# Results

A summary of our results is available below, and the full results of our analysis are available on Tableau Public here:

## Peak Hours
<img align='left' src='Resources/Peak_Hours.png' height='200'>
Peak usage hours are 5-6pm and to a lesser extent 8-9am. Bike maintenance is recommended overnight, ideally 2-5am, while usage is at its lowest.

## Checkout Locations
<img align='right' src='Resources/Checkout_Locations.png' height='200'>
Most popular bike drop-off locations coincide with the most popular locations in downtown and midtown Manhattan, which could indicate high tourist usage. Further down, we will test that hypothesis and investigate whether tourists or commuters account for the larger share of bike usage.

## Trip Duration

From the chart here, we can see that the vast majority of trips last less than 20 minutes, and 5min trips are the most common.

## Trip Duration by Gender

This breakdown by gender shows that average trip duration is quite similar for both male and female users.

## Usage by Weekday per Hour
<img align='left' src='Resources/Weekday_per_Hour.png' height='200'>
This heatmap shows the most popular days and times of usage, mostly weekdays 7-9am and 5-6pm, as well as weekends to a lesser extent (note: the data is for August, when the weather in NYC is comfortable, but winter data might yield different results). This tends to invalidate our earlier hypothesis that tourist usage is skewing the data and instead tend to show that commuters account for the majority of trips.

## Usage by Gender by Weekday per Hour
<img align='right' src='Resources/Gender_by_Weekday_per_Hour.png' height='200'>
Usage patterns remain similar when we break the data down by gender, and we can see that male usage is much higher overall.

## Usage by Gender and Weekday
<img align='left' src='Resources/Trips_by_Gender_and_Weekday.png' height='200'>
This heatmap shows that most trips are taken by subscribers, overwhelmingly male, and fairly evenly across all weekdays.
