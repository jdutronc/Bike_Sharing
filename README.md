NYC CitiBike

# Project Overview

After a very enjoyable holiday in New York City we decide to explore the business opportunity to launch a bike sharing service in our hometown of Des Moines, IA. Our friend Kate has a potential seed investor interested in our project and we must dive deeper into the mechanics of how the bike sharing service works in NYC before we can adapt the model to Des Moines.


# Results

A summary of our results is available below, and the full results of our analysis are available on Tableau Public here:

## Peak Hours

Peak usage hours are 5-6pm nd to a lesser extent 8-9am. Bike maintenance is recommended overnight, ideally 2-5am, while usage is at its lowest.

## Checkout Locations

Most popular bike drop-off locations coincide with the most popular locations in downtown and midtown Manhattan, which could indicate high tourist usage. Further down, we will test that hypothesis and investigate whether tourists or commuters account for the larger share of bike usage.

## Trip Duration

From the chart here, we can see that the vast majority of trips last less than 20 minutes, and 5min trips are the most common.
